# Statistics Plugin Overview

The Statistics Plugin is a powerful tool used to analyze streaming batches of metrics data in real-time. With a focus on time-series data, the plugin is capable of maintaining various statistical parameters including minimum, maximum, sum, count, average, and standard deviation for each unique point ID over time.

## Approach

The plugin processes incoming data in batches, updating the statistics for each unique point ID. This efficient approach makes it highly scalable, capable of handling a large number of unique point IDs and a high volume of incoming data.

For each unique point ID, the plugin maintains and updates the following statistical parameters:

- **Minimum (`min`)**: The smallest observed value for the given point ID.

- **Maximum (`max`)**: The largest observed value for the given point ID.

- **Count (`count`)**: The total number of observed values for the given point ID.

- **Sum (`sum`)**: The total sum of all observed values for the given point ID.

- **Average (`avg`)**: The average value for the given point ID. It is computed as the total sum divided by the count.

- **Standard Deviation (`stdDev`)**: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of the set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.
